# Hows does it work?

Mavericks on the Maverick DAO form swarms.

A swarm is a group of people coming together with a common purpose. eg: Clean the oceans or saving the [Amur Leopard](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/amur-leopard)

Each swarm defines their charter. A charter at the minimum consists of:

* Mission and Vision.
* Board list of activities and how it helps the bigger cause.
* A rewards and incentives model clearly detailing how community contributors will be rewarded.

The community members continue working towards their swarm's key activities and while they continue to work towards the bigger goal, they receive rewards in the form on MAVE tokens.  

Every swarm has a treasury bot that reads the swarm's charter and more importantly the rewards and incentive model of their charter.

Every week the treasury bot will distribute the MAVE tokens to the community contributors based on the contributions they've made as per the community guidelines and charter.

Community members accumulate MAVE tokens for their contributions. Eventually they will be able to swap MAVEs for another token (when MAVE gets listed) or swap MAVE for merchandise from the Community driven DAO store.
