# Getting Started

There are two minimum and mandatory steps needed to getting started on the Maverick DAO.

1. Join the Discord Server : [https://discord.gg/QUKcQVxcSu](https://discord.gg/QUKcQVxcSu)

2. Set up your wallet. Follow the instructions [here](./wallet-setup.md)


The next steps would be to browse through the different swarms and their vision and missions, and if there is a swarm that aligns with yours you can request joining the swarm. Once in a swarm, go do your thing... _put a ding in the universe._

In case you are setting up a new swarm, you can request for an airdrop, to get your swarm started.

[Here](src/projects-interested-in.md) is a list of projects we are interested in.

All airdrop submissions are voted upon by the DAO.
