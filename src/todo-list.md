# To Do List
We are just getting started with the Maverick DAO, and we could really use some help some of the important pieces of the puzzle we need are:

|Task | Bounty|
|--|--|
|A custom wallet based on Metamask, which has the Polygon Network and the MAVE token so that its super easy for the least technical folks to get setup. Setting up a wallet for Maverick DAO should be as easy as signing up for an email account. | 2,000 MAVE|
|A bot that tracks community activity and creates a weekly ledger of activities. | 3000 MAVE|
| A Treasury bot that distributes weekly rewards to the swarm members based on the contributions. | 3,000 MAVE|
|An eCommerce Portal that allows users to buy products using the MAVE Token. | 7,000 MAVE|
