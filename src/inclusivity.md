# Inclusivity

If being a Maverick sounds 'masculine' and not very inclusive, it may be due to stereotyping in [popular 1980s movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gun) or a [popular NBA club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks).

We believe Mavericks come in all shape and form and gender identity.

Inclusivity is extremely important to us.

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.
