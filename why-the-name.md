# Why the name?

Unlike popular belief that the name Maverick comes from the famous movie Top Gun, it is actually inspired from a [famous book from Ricardo Semler by the same name](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Maverick-Success-Behind-Unusual-Workplace/dp/0712678867/)

We believe this was one of the earliest works documented on autonomous organisations and we keep going back to it for inspiration and guidance.
